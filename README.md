## Overview

This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using different machine learning models. The models are trained and evaluated on the **Bank Marketing dataset** and compared in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Dataset

The **Bank Marketing dataset** includes information about clients' attributes, banking details, and the results of previous marketing campaigns. The dataset contains the following features:
- Client information (age, job, marital status, etc.)
- Previous campaign outcomes
- Client's response to the current campaign (target variable)

Dataset source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)

## Preprocessing

Before training the models, the dataset underwent the following preprocessing steps:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data was imputed or removed.
- **Class Imbalance**: Addressed using class weights and oversampling techniques.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables were encoded using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Standardization**: Numerical features were standardized to ensure the models perform optimally.

## Models

### Neural Network
- A **feedforward neural network** is implemented using scikit-learn's `MLPClassifier`.
- Hyperparameter tuning is done to find the optimal parameters for better performance.

### Random Forest
- A **Random Forest Classifier** is built using scikit-learnâ€™s ensemble method.
- Hyperparameter tuning is used to optimize the model.

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: Evaluates the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the proportion of true positives among actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.

Cross-validation and overfitting validation were also used to ensure robustness.

## Results

The results highlight the strengths and limitations of each model in terms of predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and data handling.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
